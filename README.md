Wine is of extreme importance, at various levels, for Portuguese society. Bearing in mind the economic importance, there is usefulness in using data harvesting techniques in order to answer key questions for the winemaking community, so that it can produce wines that are better suited to society and competition from existing market. To achieve this goal, it was used two datasets, which represent two types of wines, white and red. The analysis is done abstractly at most points, focusing, when necessary, on the difference between the two types. The data sets used both have a set of 12 attributes, with 4898 samples for green wine and 1599 for red wine. In this document, and in order to adhere to the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, the goal is clarifying the importance of each attribute in terms of domain knowledge and inferring important information that it can be extract from them. Then, an exploratory analysis is conducted in order to find relevant knowledge in the data, or confirm information from the domain knowledge phase. Finally, it is presented the application of different models as well as an analysis of the type of inferences that these models provide.
